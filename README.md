# Spelled-Out-Intro-to-Graph-Convolution-Networks

This repository is the implementation of the paper [SEMI-SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) by Kipf et al., ICLR 2017.

I've aimed to create a notebook that's easy to understand. It begins with a simple graph, explaining the GCN formula step by step. I implemented the GCN model using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (without relying on specific graph libraries like [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai), etc.) on the Cora dataset. Additionally, I replicated a section of the paper called "Node Embeddings With Random Weights" using the Zachary Karate Club dataset. The goal was to demonstrate how GCN can be a powerful tool for extracting features from nodes in a graph. You can check out the results in the figure below.

Going ahead, I have also implemented all the variants of the GCN mentioned in the paper which are:
- Single Parameter Model
- 1st Order term only
- 1st order model
- Chebyshev Polynomials for k = 2
- MLP
